Biometric Attendance System on Aptos

Introduction
The Biometric Attendance System is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Aptos blockchain. This system leverages biometric data (such as fingerprints, facial recognition, etc.) to manage and record attendance securely and transparently. The use of blockchain ensures that attendance records are immutable, tamper-proof, and verifiable.
